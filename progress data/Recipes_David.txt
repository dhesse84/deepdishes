i often make this dish when i have something new to do with baby carrots that don't require much cooking.

|NAME:mushrooms with garlic clove and rosemary|DESC:easy and delicious.  i was looking for something to use up some fresh mushrooms and was surprised at what i found.  thanks to kathy for the review and i have made this several times since.  i don't usually add sherry and i don't think i add dried either.  i make this with fresh mushrooms and add salt and pepper if i have them fresh, i just add salt and pepper since i don't think it gives the dish a great flavor.  i used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 c butter and 1/4 c butter instead of margarine since i used margarine.  i also used the fresh rosemary and garlic after it was already dried.  i also used a small pan instead of frying the mushrooms.  if you do use fresh rosemary, use the 2 tablespoons butter to brown the rosemary.|INGREDIENTS:['fresh mushrooms', 'butter', 'salt', 'pepper', 'fresh rosemary']|STEPS:['in a small frying pan , saute the mushrooms and garlic in 1 / 4 cup of the butter for about 4 minutes', 'add salt and pepper and rosemary and cook until they are tender', 'transfer to individual serving dishes or serve on individual plates with the butter over them', 'enjoy !']
