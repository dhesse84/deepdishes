|NAME:burrito cilantro rice
|DESC:a very mild and flavorful rice dish.  i got this recipe from a couple of the members of our family.  
i love to serve this rice with rice pilaf, with a side salad and some rice to soak up the sauce.  
the rice was so tender and flavorful that i had to throw it down in favor of the rice pilaf.  it's also great with grilled chicken and vegetable steaks.  
you can serve this with grilled jalapenos and capers as well as with lime juice and parmesan cheese.
